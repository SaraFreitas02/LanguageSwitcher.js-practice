# Language Switcher (js practice)


## Project Description
This small web project was created for personal practice and experimentation with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a basic language-switching function that allows users to toggle between English and Portuguese greetings by clicking corresponding buttons. Importantly, this project is intended solely for learning purposes, and you are free to use it as you wish, without any restrictions, obligations, or the need to mention the original creator.

## Project Structure
**index.html:** The primary HTML file that defines the webpage structure.

**style.css:** The CSS file responsible for styling the webpage and buttons.

**script.js:** The JavaScript file that handles the greeting message switching functionality.

## How to Use
Open the index.html file in a web browser (or click [here](https://sarafreitas02.github.io/js-practice.languageSwitcher1/)).

You'll find a default "Hello" greeting message and two buttons: "English" and "Portuguese."
Click the "English" button to change the greeting to "Hello," or click the "Portuguese" button to switch it to "Ol√°."
